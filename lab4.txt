Question #1
Explain how dirlookup works
It loops over the ROOTDIR file dirent by dirent.
Stop if the name stored on disk == name passed (i.e., name found).
Set offset to be the offset it stops and return a in-memory copy of the inode pointer.

Question #2
Implementing file deletion to work with journaling is not a required feature in
lab4. Describe how you can implement it in a crash-safe manner even if the file
spans multiple blocks.
Delete will update 3 things: inodefile, rootdir, and bitmap.
Since these three things are stored in different blocks, we could do the following:
    1. read current bitmap and change the bits representing the file's extent section to 0
    2. read current fileinode and clean up dinode of the file
    3. read current rootdir and clean up dirent of the file
    4. load the modified blocks into log region
    5. commit
    6. write to disk from log
Similar to create, since we have the extra work of commit and write to disk from log
by the end of the whole transaction, we can maintain a consistency even when the system crash.
