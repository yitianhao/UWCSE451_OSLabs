# Extra Credit Lab 5: Swappin' Pages
**Complete Lab Due: 3/18/21**

## Introduction
Physical machines have a limited amount of physical memory. To allow applications
(individually, or in aggregate) to consume more memory than this physical memory
limitation, the operating system uses a designated region on the disk to serve as an extended memory.
On reaching the physical memory limit, operating systems will begin to flush memory pages to disk
and load them back when needed. In this lab, we will evict pages at random.

## Part 1: Modify system setup

Currently, in QEMU (the hardware simulator), we set the amount of memory to be 16MB (4096
pages). When xk boots, it will show you how many memory pages are left. This number should
be between 3000 - 4000, depending on how memory efficient your implementation is in the previous labs.
```
cpu0: starting xk

free pages: 3601
```
You can always query the number of free pages using `sysinfo`. When memory pages are fully
utilized, `kalloc` will return 0.

We're going to bring down the physical memory demands and add some paging, so we can run on
a device with very restricted physical memory demands. First in `kernel/Makefrag` change the line:
```
QEMUOPTS += -m 16M
```
to
```
QEMUOPTS += -m 4M
```

This sets up QEMU with 4MB of physical memory. We ask you to implement a swap region of 8MB
(2048 pages). Our expectation with your implementation is that the system should behave
as if it has more than 4MB of physical memory, up to the 12MB of combined physical and swap
memory. We will not test scenarios when the system runs out
of the swap space (in a real system, one would need to correctly handle that case).


### Question #1
How is the `core_map` allocated? Is it through `kalloc`? Will the core_map ever be evicted to disk?

### Reserve swap space on disks
`mkfs.c` is a utility tool to generate the content on the hard disk. You need to modify it to add the swap section. Currently, xk's hard drive has a disk layout as the following:

```
	+------------------+  <- number of blocks in the hard drive
	|                  |
	|      Unused      |
	|                  |
	+------------------+  <- block 2 + nbitmap + size of inodes + size of extent
	|                  |
	|                  |
	|      Extent      |
	|                  |
	|                  |
	+------------------+  <- block 2 + nbitmap + size of inodes
	|                  |
	|      Inodes      |
	|                  |
	+------------------+  <- block 2 + nbitmap
	|      Bitmap      |
	+------------------+  <- block 2
	|   Super Block    |
	+------------------+  <- block 1
	|    Boot Block    |
	+------------------+  <- block 0
```

The best place to add the swap space is between the super block and the bitmap. You can
allocate 2048 * 8 blocks (each block is 512 bytes, you need 8 blocks to store a page of
memory) in the swap region.

It should now look like the following:

```
	+------------------+  <- number of blocks in the hard drive
	|                  |
	|      Unused      |
	|                  |
	+------------------+  <- block 2 + nswapblocks + nbitmap + size of inodes + size of extent
	|                  |
	|                  |
	|      Extent      |
	|                  |
	|                  |
	+------------------+  <- block 2 + nswapblocks + nbitmap + size of inodes
	|                  |
	|      Inodes      |
	|                  |
	+------------------+  <- block 2 + nswapblocks + nbitmap
	|      Bitmap      |
	+------------------+  <- block 2 + nswapblocks
	|   Swap Region    |
	+------------------+  <- block 2
	|   Super Block    |
	+------------------+  <- block 1
	|    Boot Block    |
	+------------------+  <- block 0
```

### Exercise
Add the swap region to xk's hard disk through `mkfs.c`.
Note: You should do the following:
 - add a new field to the superblock, `swapstart`.
 - define a new param, `SWAPPAGES`, indicating the number of pages the swap region can hold. This should be set to 2048.
 - define `nswapblocks` in `mkfs.c`. This should be `SWAPPAGES * 8`.
 - `nmeta` needs to be updated to have the additional blocks from the swap region.

### Question #2
`mkfs.c` has functions like `xint`, `xshort`. What is their purpose?

## Part 2: Swapping to disk

You will use `bread` and `bwrite` to read and write the disk respectively. Take a look at
`struct buf` in `inc/buf.h`. To read data from a disk block, you can use code similar to
the snippet below:
```c
struct buf *buf = bread(ROOTDEV, block_no);
memmove(mem, buf->data, BSIZE);
brelse(buf);
```
Here `block_no` should be the block number on disk. `buf` is the buffer that holds the disk
content. Each `bread` will read 512 bytes from disk. To write to a disk block, you will
need to use `bwrite`. For writes, you can use code similar to the following code snippet:
```c
struct buf *buf = bread(ROOTDEV, block_no);
memmove(buf->data, P2V(ph_addr), BSIZE);
bwrite(buf);
brelse(buf);
```

The reason you need to do `bread`, `bwrite` and then `brelse` to write to a disk block is that
there is a buffer cache layer under the block level API (e.g., `bread`, `bwrite`).
The buffer cache is a list of disk blocks that are cached in memory to reduce the number
of disk writes. If the block is already in the cache, `bread` will read from block cache;
otherwise, it loads the disk block from disk into the buffer cache. `bwrite` flush the
data in a `buf` to disk. Because there can be multiple readers/writers to a buffer cache block,
the buffer cache layer has a reference count on any in-memory disk block. `brelse` (which stands for
"block release") decrements the reference count and deallocates the in-memory disk block
when its reference count drops to 0.

The interaction of virtual memory and the file buffer cache is one of the most complex
parts of operating systems. We designed the xk interface for simplicity -- a more realistic
implementation would avoid the initial read on page evictions.


### Question #3
What will happen if xk runs out of block cache entries?

### Keep track of a memory page's state

In order to implement the swap region, you need to think about a list of questions:
- When should we flush pages to the swap region and when should we load them back?
- How should we keep track of a memory page that is in the swap region?
- What should happen when a swapped memory page is shared via copy-on-write fork?
- Is there a set of memory pages you don't want to flush to swap?
- What will happen when forking a process if some of that process's memory is in the swap region?
- What will happen when exiting a process if some of that process's memory is in the swap region?
- How will the virtual page info and page table entry structs change for memory pages that are swapped out?

You will need to define extra data structures in xk to realize those functionalities, such as
keeping track of the pages in the swap region. You can update the `vpage_info` struct to
contain information about the swap in a similar fashion to copy-on-write.

A new function, `get_random_user_page()`, has been added to `kalloc.c`. Use this
function to randomly pick a page to evict from physical memory.

### Exercise

number of disk reads = 16296
number of pages in swap = 687
swaptest OK
lab4 tests passed!!
```
Your number of disk reads and pages in swap may be different.

### Tips:
- After writing a page to disk, use `vspacemarknotpresent`. This will mark the page as not present in its page directory without calling kalloc.
- When a page is swapped into main memory, `vspaceinvalidate` needs to be called.
    - `vspaceinvalidate` will free the existing page directory, then rebuild it. This will call `kalloc()`.
    - The rebuilding processes can end up requiring 5 more additional pages than what it free'd.
- When marking a page as being swapped out, be sure to get the ppn for that page by using `PGNUM(page2pa(page_to_evict))` or `page_to_evict - core_map`.
The virtual address the `core_map_entry` stores does not have a 1 to 1 relationship with ppn's, and should not be used to get the ppn.

### Question #4
xk guarantees that a physical memory page has a single virtual address even in the case of
multiple vspaces referencing it. However, in commercial operating systems, a memory mapping
function [`mmap`](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/mmap.2.html) can map a file to any
virtual address in mutliple address spaces. How would your design for swap need to change
if a shared page can have different virtual addresses? Give a rough outline of the changes
you would make.

### Question #5
