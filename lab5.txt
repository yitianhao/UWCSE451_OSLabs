Question #1
How is the core_map allocated? Is it through kalloc? Will the core_map ever be evicted to disk?

It is allocated after kernel loaded from ELF file. It directly modifies
the start of physical address to occupy a chunk of memory.

It is not through kalloc.

It will never be evicted to disk. It's content (i.e., pages) stored might been evicted to disk, but
this structure is stored in memory.


Question #2
mkfs.c has functions like xint, xshort. What is their purpose?

Convert values from big endian to small endian and vice-versa.


Question #3
What will happen if xk runs out of block cache entries?

It will panic. "bget: no buffers"

Question #4
xk guarantees that a physical memory page has a single virtual address even in the case of
multiple vspaces referencing it. However, in commercial operating systems, a memory mapping
function mmap can map a file to any
virtual address in mutliple address spaces. How would your design for swap need to change
if a shared page can have different virtual addresses? Give a rough outline of the changes
you would make.

Instead of looping through processes to find the same virtual address, we can find the physical address
of the evicting page in their page tables.

Question #5
For each member of the project team, how many hours did you spend on this lab?

Kelvin Fang: 8 hours
Yitian Hao: 5.5 hours
